# Word Embedding Exercise

This was an instructional exercise carried out in Week 1 of the [iXperience Applied AI](http://ixperience.co.za/courses/applied-ai) course.

The word embeddings were created on a very small vocabulary consisting of only words appearing in a single New York Times article, so the Word2Vec model created with them cannot be generalized to useful NLP purposes.
